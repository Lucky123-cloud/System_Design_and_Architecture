Tracing in Distributed Systems
==============================

Overview
--------
- Logging and monitoring (metrics) are well-known methods.
- Distributed tracing is newer and essential for understanding request flows in microservices.
- Metrics and logs provide insights into individual services.
- Tracing shows how a request is processed across multiple services.

What is a Trace?
----------------
- A trace tracks a request as it moves through services.
- A trace consists of multiple spans.
- Each span represents a unit of work or event during the request lifecycle.
- A span includes:
  - Start and finish time
  - Name
  - Tags (metadata)
  - Log messages

Tracing Systems
---------------
- Traces are collected and analyzed by tracing systems like Jaeger.

Standardization and OpenTelemetry
---------------------------------
- Initially, there were competing standards: OpenTracing and OpenCensus.
- In 2019, OpenTracing and OpenCensus merged into OpenTelemetry.
- OpenTelemetry is now a CNCF project.
- Provides APIs, SDKs, and tools to integrate telemetry data:
  - Metrics
  - Logs
  - Traces (focus)
- OpenTelemetry clients export data in a standardized format.
- Data can be sent to platforms like Jaeger for storage and analysis.
- Extensive tool support is available via the OpenTelemetry documentation.

Summary
-------
Distributed tracing complements logs and metrics by providing end-to-end visibility 
into how requests flow through distributed systems. OpenTelemetry enables consistent 
collection and export of telemetry data across diverse environments.
