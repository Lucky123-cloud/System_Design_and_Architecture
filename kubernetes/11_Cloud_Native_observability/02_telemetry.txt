TELEMETRY
=========

1. ORIGIN
---------
- From Greek: "tele" (remote/distance) + "metry" (measuring).
- Means measuring and collecting data remotely and sending it to another system.

2. EXAMPLE OUTSIDE IT
---------------------
- Weather stations measure temperature, humidity, wind speed.
- Data is transmitted to a system for processing and display.

3. TELEMETRY IN CONTAINER SYSTEMS
---------------------------------
- Every application should generate information data.
- Data is collected and sent to a centralized system.
- Telemetry data is divided into three main categories:

4. THREE DATA CATEGORIES
------------------------
- LOGS:
  - Messages emitted by applications for errors, warnings, or debug info.
  - Example: task start and end messages.

- METRICS:
  - Quantitative measurements over time.
  - Examples: number of requests, error rates.

- TRACES:
  - Track the lifecycle of a request through the system.
  - Show when and how long each service took to process the request.

5. CHALLENGE WITH TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS
-------------------------------------
- Logs and data often not centralized.
- Viewing logs requires direct connection to systems.
- Troubleshooting distributed systems with many services is time-consuming.

6. BENEFITS OF TELEMETRY IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
-----------------------------------------------
- Centralized data collection.
- Easier troubleshooting and monitoring.
- Better insight into system behavior.
