OBSERVABILITY
=============

1. DEFINITION
-------------
- Often confused with monitoring, but monitoring is just one subcategory.
- Observability is rooted in control theory about dynamic systems behavior.
- Control theory focuses on measuring external outputs to influence system behavior.

2. EXAMPLE: CRUISE CONTROL
--------------------------
- Desired car speed is set and constantly measured (speedometer).
- To maintain speed uphill, engine power is adjusted.
- Similar concept applies to autoscaling in IT systems.

3. OBSERVABILITY IN IT SYSTEMS
------------------------------
- Set desired system utilization.
- Trigger scaling or other events based on load.
- Main challenge is tracking system behavior, interactions, and performance under load or errors.

4. KEY QUESTIONS OBSERVABILITY ANSWERS
--------------------------------------
- Is the system stable or does it change state under manipulation?
- Is the system sensitive to changes (e.g., latency in some services)?
- Do any metrics exceed thresholds?
- Why do certain requests fail?
- Are there bottlenecks?

5. PURPOSE AND BENEFITS
-----------------------
- Enables data analysis for better understanding.
- Helps in reacting to errors or performance issues.
- Supports agile software development feedback loops.
- Encourages continuous adaptation based on system behavior.
