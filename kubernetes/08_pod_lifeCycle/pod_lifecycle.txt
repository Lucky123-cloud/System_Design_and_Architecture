3. POD LIFECYCLE IN KUBERNETES

OVERVIEW
--------
Pods go through a defined lifecycle from creation to completion or failure. The state of a Pod helps describe what is happening with the containers inside.

POD LIFECYCLE PHASES
--------------------

1. PENDING
-----------
- The Pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes cluster.
- One or more of its containers are not yet ready to run.
- This includes:
  - Time spent waiting to be scheduled onto a Node.
  - Time spent pulling container images.

2. RUNNING
-----------
- The Pod has been assigned to a Node.
- All containers have been created successfully.
- At least one container is either:
  - Actively running,
  - Starting, or
  - Restarting.

3. SUCCEEDED
-------------
- All containers in the Pod have exited successfully (exit code 0).
- No containers will be restarted.
- The Pod has completed its job.

4. FAILED
----------
- All containers have terminated.
- At least one container has failed (non-zero exit code or killed).
- The Pod is considered failed.

5. UNKNOWN
-----------
- The Pod’s state cannot be determined.
- Usually caused by issues in communication with the Node.

NOTE
----
Kubernetes does not restart Pods by default. Instead, higher-level controllers like Deployments or ReplicaSets manage restarting or replacing Pods.
