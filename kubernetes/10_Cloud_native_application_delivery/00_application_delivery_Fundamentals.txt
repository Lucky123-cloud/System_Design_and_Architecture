APPLICATION DELIVERY FUNDAMENTALS
================================

1. SOURCE CODE MANAGEMENT
-------------------------
- Every application starts with source code.
- Source code is intellectual property and capital.
- Best managed by a version control system.

2. GIT VERSION CONTROL
----------------------
- Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
- Industry standard for version control.
- Decentralized system tracking changes in code.
- Supports branches or forks for isolated development.
- Changes merged back into the main branch after review.
- Highly recommended to learn Git deeply.

3. BUILDING THE APPLICATION
---------------------------
- After managing source code, next step is building the application.
- Building can include creating container images (see Container Orchestration).
- Builds package your app for deployment.

4. TESTING
----------
- Automated and extensive testing ensures quality.
- Validates that functionality remains intact after changes.

5. APPLICATION DELIVERY
-----------------------
- Deliver your app to the target platform (e.g., Kubernetes).
- Use YAML manifests for deployment configuration.
- Push container images to registries for Kubernetes to pull.

6. INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE (IaC)
-------------------------------
- Source code management now also applies to infrastructure.
- Describe infrastructure via code files rather than manual setup.
- Use cloud vendor APIs to provision infrastructure automatically.
- Allows developers greater involvement in infrastructure setup.
- Facilitates repeatable, version-controlled infrastructure changes.
