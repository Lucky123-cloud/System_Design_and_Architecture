1. POD LIFECYCLE IN KUBERNETES  

OVERVIEW  
--------  
Pods go through several **phases** from creation to termination. These phases help track what’s happening with a Pod at any point in time.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
POD LIFECYCLE PHASES  

1. Pending  
   - Pod accepted by the cluster.  
   - Containers not created yet.  
   - May be waiting to be scheduled or downloading images.  

2. Running  
   - Pod assigned to a node.  
   - All containers created; at least one is running or starting/restarting.  

3. Succeeded  
   - All containers exited successfully (exit code 0).  
   - Pod will not restart.  

4. Failed  
   - All containers stopped, but at least one failed (non-zero exit code or crash).  
   - Pod will not restart.  

5. Unknown  
   - Kubernetes can’t determine Pod state (e.g., node unreachable).  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
NOTES  
-----  
- A Pod starts in **Pending**, moves to **Running**, and ends in either **Succeeded** or **Failed**.  
- **Unknown** happens rarely and usually indicates a problem in communication.  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
EXTRA TIPS  
----------  
- Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to see why a Pod is stuck in a phase.  
- Use `kubectl get pods` to see the current phase/status.  
- Failed Pods may require checking logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`.
