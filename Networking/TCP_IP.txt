transmission control Protocols/Internet Protocols
OSI is for any two devices, whereas TCP/IP is for onlu the internet.

TCP/IP MODEL
============

Definition:
-----------
The TCP/IP model (also called the Internet Protocol Suite) is a practical framework used in real-world networking, especially the internet. It has **4 layers** instead of 7 (as in the OSI model).

LAYERS OF THE TCP/IP MODEL (Top to Bottom)
------------------------------------------

4. Application Layer
---------------------
- Combines the OSI model’s Application, Presentation, and Session layers.
- Handles all high-level protocols and data formatting for apps.
- Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, Telnet

3. Transport Layer
-------------------
- Responsible for end-to-end communication and error handling.
- Manages data segmentation, flow control, and reliability.
- Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (faster, no guarantee)

2. Internet Layer
------------------
- Handles logical addressing and routing.
- Moves packets across different networks (internetworking).
- Protocols: IP (v4/v6), ICMP, ARP, IGMP

1. Network Access Layer (Link Layer)
-------------------------------------
- Covers both the OSI’s Data Link and Physical layers.
- Deals with how data is physically transmitted (e.g., cables, Wi-Fi).
- Includes MAC addresses, frame formatting, and hardware-level delivery.

COMPARISON: TCP/IP vs OSI Model
-------------------------------

| OSI Model          | TCP/IP Model          |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Application        | Application            |
| Presentation       |          ↑             |
| Session            |          ↑             |
| Transport          | Transport              |
| Network            | Internet               |
| Data Link          |          ↓             |
| Physical           | Network Access (Link)  |

Key Differences:
----------------
- OSI is a **theoretical model**; TCP/IP is the **real-world implementation**.
- OSI has 7 layers; TCP/IP has 4 layers.
- TCP/IP protocols are the foundation of the internet.
