UDP vs TCP
==========

Definition of UDP:
------------------
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a lightweight, connectionless transport protocol.
It sends messages, called **datagrams**, without setting up a connection and without guaranteeing delivery, order, or error checking.

Key Characteristics of UDP:
----------------------------
- **No connection setup**: Sends data immediately without a handshake.
- **No reliability**: No acknowledgment if the data was received.
- **No ordering**: Packets may arrive out of order.
- **Low overhead**: Faster and more efficient for real-time applications.
- **Best-effort delivery**: Send and forget.

Common Use Cases for UDP:
--------------------------
- Online gaming
- Live video or audio streaming
- Voice over IP (VoIP)
- DNS queries
- TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

Definition of TCP:
------------------
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a heavy, connection-oriented protocol.
It establishes a connection before sending data and ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery.

Key Characteristics of TCP:
----------------------------
- **Connection setup**: Requires a three-way handshake before sending data.
- **Reliability**: Guarantees data arrives successfully.
- **Ordering**: Packets are reassembled in the correct order.
- **Error checking**: Detects missing or corrupted data and resends it.
- **Higher overhead**: More control but slightly slower.

Common Use Cases for TCP:
--------------------------
- Web browsing (HTTP, HTTPS)
- Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
- File transfers (FTP)
- Remote administration (SSH)

Main Differences: (Quick Summary)
---------------------------------

| Feature             | TCP                                  | UDP                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Connection          | Connection-oriented (handshake)     | Connectionless (no handshake)      |
| Reliability         | Reliable delivery                   | No guarantee of delivery          |
| Ordering            | Ordered data transfer               | No ordering                       |
| Speed               | Slower (more overhead)               | Faster (low overhead)              |
| Use Cases           | Web, Email, File Transfer            | Streaming, Gaming, VoIP, DNS       |
| Error Checking      | Yes, with retransmission             | Minimal, best-effort delivery      |

Simple Analogy:
---------------
- **TCP is like sending a package by courier with tracking**: 
  - The courier confirms delivery, handles lost packages, and keeps them in order.

- **UDP is like mailing a postcard**: 
  - You just send it â€” no guarantee it gets there, no tracking, but it's fast and simple.
