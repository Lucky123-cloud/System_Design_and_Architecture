It is a conceptual and logical model that defines the network communication between a system
in order to communicate with another system

Think of it as two computers commununicate they utilze OSI Model.


OSI MODEL (Open Systems Interconnection)
=========================================

Definition:
-----------
The OSI Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and design how data is transmitted across a network. It breaks the process into 7 abstract layers.

LAYERS OF THE OSI MODEL (Top to Bottom)
----------------------------------------

7. Application Layer
---------------------
- Closest to the end-user.
- Interfaces directly with software applications.
- Handles network services like email, file transfer, and browsing.
- Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, POP3

6. Presentation Layer
----------------------
- Ensures data is in a readable format for the Application Layer.
- Handles data translation, encryption/decryption, and compression.
- Think of it as the “translator” of the network.

5. Session Layer
-----------------
- Manages sessions or connections between two applications.
- Responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions.
- Handles authentication and session recovery.

4. Transport Layer
-------------------
- Ensures reliable data transmission between devices.
- Performs error checking and data flow control.
- Segments and reassembles data.
- Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (faster but unreliable)

3. Network Layer
-----------------
- Responsible for routing, addressing, and delivering data between networks.
- Handles logical addressing (IP addresses).
- Decides the best physical path (routing).
- Protocols: IP, ICMP, ARP, BGP, OSPF

2. Data Link Layer
-------------------
- Deals with node-to-node data transfer.
- Handles MAC addresses, error detection/correction (not correction in all cases), and frame synchronization.
- Protocols: Ethernet, PPP, HDLC

1. Physical Layer
------------------
- The lowest layer — responsible for transmitting raw bits over the medium.
- Deals with cables, switches, voltages, pin layout, and signaling.
- No understanding of the actual data; only 0s and 1s.
