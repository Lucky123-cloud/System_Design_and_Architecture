The main goal of system design is to Engineer and Build systems that meet the needs
of the business in coherent, efficient and organized way

We do this by designing the architecture, interfaces and data of the system
The two main core principles of system design is Availability and reliabilty


AVAILABILITY IN SYSTEM DESIGN
=============================

What is Availability?
---------------------
Availability refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible when needed â€” even in the face of failures. A highly available system is up and responsive most of the time.

Formula:
  Availability = (Uptime) / (Uptime + Downtime)

Common "Nines" of Availability:
  - 99%     => ~3.65 days downtime/year
  - 99.9%   => ~8.76 hours/year
  - 99.99%  => ~52.6 minutes/year
  - 99.999% => ~5.26 minutes/year

Availability vs Reliability vs Durability:
  - Availability: System is up and responsive
  - Reliability: System performs correctly without failure
  - Durability: Once data is written, it stays written

Availability in Distributed Systems
-----------------------------------
To achieve high availability:
  1. Redundancy (multiple servers, multiple data centers)
  2. Failover mechanisms (automatic switch on failure)
  3. Load balancing (distributes traffic evenly)
  4. Replication (copies of data for fault tolerance)
  5. Health checks & monitoring (early failure detection)

Design Patterns that Support Availability:
  - Leader-Follower Replication
  - Quorum-based Reads/Writes
  - Circuit Breakers
  - Retry Mechanisms with Exponential Backoff

CAP Theorem and Trade-offs
--------------------------
In distributed systems, you can only guarantee two of the following three:
  - Consistency
  - Availability
  - Partition Tolerance

If a network partition occurs, you must choose:
  - CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance): prioritizes correct data over being always up
  - AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance): prioritizes being up even if some data is stale

Examples:
---------
  - Amazon DynamoDB: Highly Available (AP)
  - Google Spanner: Consistent and Partition Tolerant (CP)
  - Netflix Systems: Prioritize Availability
