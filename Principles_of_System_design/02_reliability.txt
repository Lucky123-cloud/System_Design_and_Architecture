CALCULATING RELIABILITY
========================

Key Metrics:
------------
1. MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures): average time the system runs before it fails.
2. MTTR (Mean Time To Repair): average time it takes to fix the system after a failure.

Formula:
--------
Reliability ≈ MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)

Example Scenario:
-----------------
Let’s say you have a system with the following stats:
- MTBF = 900 hours
- MTTR = 100 hours

Step 1: Plug into the formula.

Reliability = 900 / (900 + 100)
            = 900 / 1000
            = 0.9

Step 2: Convert to percentage.

Reliability = 90%

This means the system is expected to function correctly **90% of the time**, and 10% of the time it will either be down or recovering from a failure.

Another Example (More Reliable System):
---------------------------------------
- MTBF = 3600 hours
- MTTR = 40 hours

Reliability = 3600 / (3600 + 40)
            = 3600 / 3640
            ≈ 0.989
            ≈ **98.9% Reliable**

Interpretation:
---------------
- A higher MTBF (more time between failures) and lower MTTR (faster recovery) leads to higher reliability.
- Reliability is about **correct operation over time**, not just being "up."




ANOTHER WAY OF CALCULATING RELIABILITY
=======================================

Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
---------------------------------
MTBF = Total Time in Service / Number of Failures

Example:
--------
- Total time in service = 300 hours
- Number of failures = 5

MTBF = 300 / 5 = 60 hours

Interpretation:
---------------
This means the system, on average, runs for **60 hours** before a failure occurs.
So, there is likely to be a **reliability issue every 60 hours** of operation.

Note:
-----
This method assumes:
- Past performance is a reasonable predictor of future performance
- Failures are randomly distributed

You can combine this MTBF value with MTTR to calculate overall **system reliability** using:

  Reliability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
